                <Card.Text>
                  Hello, I'm Dagmawi Girma, a dedicated and innovative software engineer with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I thrive on tackling complex challenges and pushing the boundaries of technology.

                  My professional journey includes impactful roles as a Software Engineer at Travelers Insurance, where I excelled in developing and maintaining sophisticated full-stack applications. During my tenure as an intern at Travelers Insurance, I was part of the DevOps team, where I gained hands-on experience in optimizing application performance and streamlining development processes.

                  I also contributed to Celigo as a Support Engineer, where I was instrumental in automating processes and refining API configurations to enhance operational efficiency.

                  During my time at Augsburg University, I engineered a system for autonomous robots to detect and diagnose faults, enhancing self-repair capabilities.

                  I designed and implemented a reinforcement learning environment for an RVR robot, using visual servoing techniques to improve navigational accuracy.

                  I conducted experiments across various terrains, analyzed sensory data, and resolved complex hardware and software issues, which increased system reliability and reduced downtime by 30%.
