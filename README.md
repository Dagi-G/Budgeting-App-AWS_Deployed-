# BudgetWeb App

This is my budget app which I created from scratch, including server-side configurations, API endpoints, MongoDb component and the UI using React.

## Description

BudgetWeb is a web application designed to help users track their expenses across different months. Users can input their budget data, which is stored in MongoDB, and manage it through a user-friendly interface. The app allows for adding, editing, and deleting budget entries directly from the UI, with changes reflected in the MongoDB database.

## Installation and Setup

    cd server

2. Install dependencies:
